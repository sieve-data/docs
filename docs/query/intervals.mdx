<Request method="POST">https://api.sievedata.com/v1/intervals</Request>

Retrieve a set of intervals within a video which match a query. Usage works in the same way as the [/query](/query/metadata) endpoint. The only difference is the return payload which will be a list of all intervals that match your query within each video you've submitted to your project.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- |
| `project_name` | string | The name of the project |
| `next_start` | (optional) int | The amount of objects to skip in query (defaults to 0, used for paging) |
| `YOUR_TAG` | (optional) object or string | One of many tags in your schema. (you can specify as many of these as you want). These can be queried for in mongo format.

**Note**: For projects with a field in the tag schema that contains has a "_type" of "text", you can use the [MongoDB Legacy text query engine](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/text-search-operators/) to search for text information throughout the project. For more information, get started with a text enabled project like E-Sports or Live Social today!

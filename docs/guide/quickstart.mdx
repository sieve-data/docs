- Install the Sieve Python client

```bash
pip install sievedata
```

- Login with your API key

If running on a terminal:

```bash
sieve login
```

If terminal interaction isn't possible, set the `SIEVE_API_KEY` as an environment variable:

```bash
export SIEVE_API_KEY=YOUR_SIEVE_API_KEY
```

### **Submitting your first Sieve Job**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pushing a Sieve Job">
    Using UI:
    Navigate to your function on the [Sieve Playground](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/dubbing) and upload a sample file to test out your app.

    Using CLI:
    You can also call your function via [API call](/reference-v2/api/create-new-job) or the [Python client](/guide/custom-apps/referencing-functions).

    <Info>Make sure to replace `<your-api-key>` with your API key.</Info>

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash API
    curl -X POST \
      --url https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push \
      -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "function": "sieve/dubbing"
        "inputs": {
          "file": {"url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/bbf89d2d-9dfa-4c38-86b1-f3f2bbe5ac61/34813c02-f6a5-4862-96bf-0e52fa0d168c-input-source_file.mp4"},
          "target_language": "spanish"
        }
      }'
    ```

    ```python Python Client
    import sieve

    source_file = sieve.File(url="https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/bbf89d2d-9dfa-4c38-86b1-f3f2bbe5ac61/34813c02-f6a5-4862-96bf-0e52fa0d168c-input-source_file.mp4")
    dubbing = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing")
    target_language = "spanish"
    output = dubbing.run(source_file, target_language)

    for output_object in output:
      print(output_object.path)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitoring Job Status">
    Using UI:
    Navigate to your [Sieve Dashboard](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard) and the job will have appeared there.
    
    Using CLI:
    To fetch job and it's status use the [API call](/reference-v2/api/get-job).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Running a job on Sieve is that simple\!
You can customize parameters and test more function specific specs on the [Dubbing's Function Page](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/dubbing/guide).

In production, you may choose to run jobs that are quite long, so you may choose to use our async API. Here is how you might do that in curl and Python

<Tip>
  For more production integration options, check out our section on
  [webhooks](/guide/advanced/webhooks).

## NOTE: HYPOTHETICAL OUTLINE BELOW, NEED TO FLESH OUT - kept as reference for now

Let's take this clip of a Steve Jobs interview

Let's dub this video into a language of our choice, say Spanish

Here is how we can send a job to Sieve, your request should finish in a few minutes.

Note: Toggle between curl /run??? Stupid to give a /push thing the way we do for the first user interaction.
and toggle to python .run.

Should clarify this is nice for quite iteration and integration but we don't recommend this in production settings idk.

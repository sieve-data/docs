## Note: SHOULD MAKE THIS MORE LIKE https://docs.exa.ai/reference/quickstart. LESS IS MORE

## **Getting Started**

Every account comes with $20 of credit to get you started:

- [Sign up](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard) and get your [API key](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings)
- Install the Sieve Python client

```bash
pip install sievedata
```

- Login with your API key

If running on a terminal:

```bash
sieve login
```

If terminal interaction isn't possible, set the `SIEVE_API_KEY` as an environment variable:

```bash
export SIEVE_API_KEY=YOUR_SIEVE_API_KEY
```

## NOTE: HYPOTHETICAL OUTLINE BELOW, NEED TO FLESH OUT

Let's take this clip of a Steve Jobs interview

Let's dub this video into a language of our choice, say Spanish

Here is how we can send a job to Sieve, your request should finish in a few minutes.

Note: Toggle between curl /run??? Stupid to give a /push thing the way we do for the first user interaction.
and toggle to python .run.

Should clarify this is nice for quite iteration and integration but we don't recommend this in production settings idk.

In production, you may choose to run jobs that are quite long, so you may choose to use our async API. Here is how you might do that in curl and Python

For more production integration options, check out our section on webhooks

Running a job on Sieve is that simple! Try one of our many other APIs here: you can see the spec for the APIs on the website. Click some of the links in our sidebar to view apps specific guides

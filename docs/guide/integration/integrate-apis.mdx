    ## Running functions via API

    You can run any function via the [Push](/reference-v2/api/create-new-job) endpoint.

    For this example, we are using the [Dubbing API](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/dubbing). You can explore more API functions through the [explore page](https://www.sievedata.com/explore) and use them as `sieve/function-name`.

    ```bash API
    curl -X POST \
      --url https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push \
      -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "function": "sieve/dubbing",
        "inputs": {
          "file": {"url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/c27fa3e7-d590-4208-ab8e-57fe69e7a4b9/9acf16f7-be0e-4522-a933-13abcd2fd6e3-input-source_file.mp4"},
          "target_language": "spanish"
        }
      }'
    ```

    The response will be a JSON object describing the job. Use the job `id` from this response to get the status and outputs of the job. For more information, refer to the [Job Outputs](reference-v2/api/get-job-outputs) endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can monitor your job in the [dashboard](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard) where you can visualize outputs.

    <Note>
      Function inputs and outputs vary by function. Please refer to
      the respective function's [Usage
      Guide](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/autocrop/guide) for more
      information about integration.

    ## Running functions in Python

    You can also reference and run functions directly in Python. This approach offers several key benefits:

    - Functions return Python objects directly rather than JSON
    - Asynchronous job handling is supported without the need to poll for outputs or job status
    - Calling a function from inside a Sieve function is faster and takes advantage of file caching. Contact us to learn more.

    ```python Python Client
    import sieve

    source_file = sieve.File(url="https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/c27fa3e7-d590-4208-ab8e-57fe69e7a4b9/9acf16f7-be0e-4522-a933-13abcd2fd6e3-input-source_file.mp4")
    dubbing = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing")
    target_language = "spanish"
    output = dubbing.run(source_file, target_language)

    for output_object in output:
      print(output_object.path)
    ```

    Here, `output_object.path` will contain the local path(s) to the output file(s).

    Alternatively, you can monitor your job in the [dashboard](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard) where you can visualize outputs.

    <Note>
      Function inputs and outputs vary by function. Please refer to
      the respective function's [Usage
      Guide](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/autocrop/guide) for more
      information about integration.
    </Note>

    The Sieve Python client supports both synchronous and asynchronous function execution. Let's use the [Dubbing API](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/dubbing) as an example.

    You can also `push` to a function's queue and wait for the request to complete asynchronously. This is particularly beneficial when sending multiple requests simultaneously. The `push` method returns a Python future, which can be used with other Python async utilities.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Sync Calls
    # Running Dubbing synchronously
    dubbing = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing")
    dubbing_job = dubbing.run(file, target_language="spanish")
    ```

    ```python Async Calls
    # Running Dubbing asynchronously
    dubbing = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing")
    dubbing_job = dubbing.push(file, target_language="spanish")

    # dubbing_job is a Python future, so you can use it in a non-blocking way
    print(dubbing_job) # <Future at 0x7f8e3c3e3e50 state=running>
    for output_object in dubbing_job.result():
        print(output_object.path) # Path of dubbed file
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Note>
      For functions that return a single output, `.result()` will block until the
      output is ready. For functions that return multiple outputs, `.result()` will
      return immediately with a generator object. Iterating over the generator will
      block until each output is ready.
    </Note>

    The job result object may or may not be a generator, depending on the function. For example, the [Lipsync API](https://www.sievedata.com/functions/sieve/lipsync) returns a single output rather than a generator.
    Here's how to use it asynchronously:

    ```python Async Calls
    # Running Lipsync asynchronously
    import sieve

    file = sieve.File(url="https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/40932012-cf32-4c74-bb2b-1ddcd6f51fa7/9ea77af1-518e-4c1c-aae6-0feca93b56dd-input-file.mp4")
    audio = sieve.File(url="https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/40932012-cf32-4c74-bb2b-1ddcd6f51fa7/9ea77af1-518e-4c1c-aae6-0feca93b56dd-input-audio.wav")

    lipsync = sieve.function.get("sieve/lipsync")
    output = lipsync.push(file, audio)

    print(output)
    # Execute other code
    # ...
    # ...
    future_result = output.result()
    print(future_result.path) # Path of synced file
    ```

Sieve has [many functions available](https://sievedata.com/explore) to reference in your code out of the box. Instead of rewriting the code for popular models and building blocks, you can use shared functions in a few lines.

There's a few ways to run a public function, each of which is outlined on the function's [usage guide](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/autocrop/guide).

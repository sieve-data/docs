Sieve has [many functions available](https://sievedata.com/explore) to reference in your code out of the box. Instead of rewriting the code for popular models and building blocks, you can use shared functions in a few lines.

There's a few ways to run a public function, each of which is outlined on the function's usage guide (ex: [sieve/autocrop](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/autocrop/usage)):
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion defaultOpen={true} title="Run with API">
    Here's an example of running the [sieve/autocrop](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/autocrop) with a cURL request.

    <Info>Make sure you replace your API key with the key from your [settings](https://sievedata.com/dashboard/settings)</Info>

    ```bash
    curl "https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push" \
        -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' \
        -d '{
            "function": "sieve/autocrop",
            "inputs": {
                "file": {
                    "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/a3db863d-aaff-4243-9cd2-846bc9a64925/8888b955-21e9-4e59-b285-bf07437f76b9-input-file.mp4"
                }
            }
        }'
    ```

    You should now see your job running in the [dashboard](https://sievedata.com/dashboard/jobs) where you can visualize outputs. You can also get job outputs via [the API](/reference-v2/api/get-job).

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Run with Python Client">

    To run public functions with the client, we must first install the Sieve Python client & log in. You can find your API key [here](https://sievedata.com/dashboard/settings).
    ```bash
    pip install sievedata
    sieve login
    ```

    Next, we'll run some Python:
    ```python
    import sieve

    file = sieve.File(url="https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-prod-us-central1-public-file-upload-bucket/a3db863d-aaff-4243-9cd2-846bc9a64925/8888b955-21e9-4e59-b285-bf07437f76b9-input-file.mp4")
    autocrop = sieve.function.get("sieve/autocrop")
    output = autocrop.run(file)
    print(list(output))
    ```

    You'll see your output directly returned in your Python code. You can also visualize your outputs in the [dashboard](https://sievedata.com/dashboard/jobs).

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Run from Dashboard">
        From the explore page, clicking on any public function (ex: [sieve/autocrop](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/autocrop)) will let you input your own data on the right and click "Submit". This will run your job and visualize your outputs on completion.

In this example, we'll walk through a simple use case of Sieve and learn how to:

- Call an existing Sieve function in Python using the Sieve Python package
- Make a call via the Sieve API and poll for results

## **Introduction**

Audio transcription helps transcribe audio to spoken word, which can be useful for applications like captioning, accessibility, content analysis, and more. Letâ€™s explore using an app that already exists on Sieve for this use case.

## **Using the Python client**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Sieve package and login">
    ```bash
    pip install sievedata
    ```

    Find your API key on the [Sieve dashboard](https://sievedata.com/dashboard/settings) and login on the CLI.

    ```bash
    sieve login
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create transcriber script">
    Create a new Python file named `transcriber.py` with the following code:

    ```python
    import sieve

    def transcribe_audio():
        target_audio = sieve.File(
            url="https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-public-data/assets/dub.m4a")

        transcriber = sieve.function.get("sieve/speech_transcriber")
        transcription_result = transcriber.run(target_audio)
        for i in transcription_result:
            print(i)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        transcribe_audio()
    ```

    This Python script:
    - Initializes a Sieve typed audio object and passes a URL to it (you can also pass a local path)
    - Gets a remote function by reference for audio transcription
    - Synchronously executes that remote function using `.run()`
    - Prints out the transcription

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute the code">

    ```bash
    python transcriber.py
    ```

    Congrats, you just ran your first Sieve app! You should see something similar to this output in your terminal.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "start": 0.009,
            "end": 7.733,
            "text": "There were a lot of other businesses that just kind of fell by the wayside because they just couldn't make the adaptation from desktop to mobile computing.",
            "words": [
                {
                    "start": 0.009,
                    "end": 0.109,
                    "score": 0.069,
                    "word": "There"
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "start": 7.733,
            "end": 9.774,
            "text": "I think AI is going to be like that for SaaS.",
            "words": [
                {
                    "start": 7.733,
                    "end": 7.813,
                    "score": 0.787,
                    "word": "I"
                },
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

By following these steps, we converted audio content to text in just a few lines of code. Just like this app, there are plenty of production-ready apps you can reference in code [here](https://www.sievedata.com/explore).

## **Using the HTTP API**

You can also submit a job via the API by sending a POST request to the **`/v2/push`** endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push' \
  -X POST
  -H 'X-API-Key: <your api key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "function": "sieve/speech_transcriber",
    "inputs": {
      "file": {
        "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-public-data/assets/dub.m4a"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Upon successful submission, you'll receive a response containing the `job_id` and other details:

```json
{
  "id": "898ccb04-fce3-4dec-83bd-c7569bfdc30b",
  "run_id": "898ccb04-fce3-4dec-83bd-c7569bfdc30b-653a14e7-7a48-4c8c-872b-6715a28aca1f",
  "stream_output": true,
  "status": "queued",
  "organization_id": "c0ec7825-0fcb-444e-b0b9-9660c40fa0f4",
  "model_id": "c110b79c-5dce-46f5-9431-0a95dbcce8c9"
}
```

<Info>An alternative to polling is using webhooks, see the docs [here](/guide/custom-apps/using-webhooks).</Info>
To check the status of a job and retrieve its results, poll the **`/v2/jobs/<your-job-id>`** endpoint and check the `status` field:

```bash
curl 'https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/jobs/<your-job-id>' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: <your api key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

Your result should look something like:

```json
{
  "id": "898ccb04-fce3-4dec-83bd-c7569bfdc30b",
  "function_id": "c110b79c-5dce-46f5-9431-0a95dbcce8c9",
  "status": "finished",
  "created_at": "2023-10-05T22:45:34.238000",
  "started_at": "2023-10-05T22:45:34.245000",
  "completed_at": "2023-10-05T22:45:36.970000",
  ...
  "outputs": [
    {
      "type": "list",
      "name": null,
      "data": [
        {
          "start": 0.009,
          "end": 7.733,
          "text": " There were a lot of other businesses that just kind of fell by the wayside because they just couldn't make the adaptation from desktop to mobile computing.",
          "words": [
            {
              "start": 0.009,
              "end": 0.109,
              "score": 0.069,
              "word": "There"
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        {
          "start": 7.733,
          "end": 9.774,
          "text": "I think AI is going to be like that for SaaS.",
          "words": [
            {
              "start": 7.733,
              "end": 7.813,
              "score": 0.787,
              "word": "I"
            },
            ...
          ]
        }
      ],
      "description": null
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

The **`outputs`** field contains a list of output files generated by the job. Each output is described by a type and a URL where the file can be downloaded.

## **Introduction**

A common usecase for transcription is transcribing RTMP or HLS livestreams. Let's walk through deploying a custom function to Sieve that can ingest a livestream and pass it into other functions using Sieve's function calling capabilities for the purposes of transcription & translation.

## **Clone repo and run the example**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Login with Sieve client">
    To get started, make sure you're logged in via the Sieve Python client:
    ```bash
    sieve login
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone example">
    Clone the Sieve examples repository and navigate into the `audio_transcription` directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sieve-community/examples
    cd examples/audio_transcription
    ```

    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy custom function">
    The code we'll be deploying can be found at `examples/audio_transcription/live_transcriber.py`.

    This is an example ofa custom function to Sieve that can ingest a livestream and pass it into other functions using Sieve's function calling capabilities.

    We won't dive too deep into what the code does but at a high level it:
    1. Imports necessary libraries and modules.
    2. Loads the `sieve/whisperx` model and `sieve/seamless_text2text` model for translation.
    3. Takes in audio from `ffmpeg` at a specified chunk size, splits by the last silence in the audio to prevent splitting words.
    4. Runs transcription and translation if needed and yields out results with its start and end time.


    Let's deploy our function!
    ```bash
    sieve deploy live_transcriber.py
    ```

    Replicas of the live transcriber automatically scale to zero when there is no traffic, so be sure to check out the [autoscaling](/guide/custom-apps/autoscaling) guide to learn more about how to configure autoscaling for your custom functions if you want to keep them running and ready to process requests. You may otherwise notice a slight delay when you first call the function as the replicas are scaled up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try it out!">
    Let's now use our function to transcribe a live audio stream in Python. Make sure to replace **`{your_org}`** with your actual organization name. You can find your organization name in the [dashboard settings](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings).

    ```python
    import sieve

    url = "http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_world_service" # Public BBC service
    language = "eng" # If this language is different from the stream, translation will happen automatically

    live_speech_transcriber = sieve.function.get("{your_org}/live_transcriber")
    output = live_speech_transcriber.push(url, target_language=language)

    print(f"Started job with id {output.job['id']}")

    print("stream ingestor initializing (please set a replica if you'd like for this to be instant)...")
    for segment in output.result():
        print(segment)
    ```

    The segment output will print as it's being transcribed. You may also push a job via the REST API [here](/reference-v2/api/push) and later poll for outputs with [this endpoint](/reference-v2/api/jobs/get).

    This is an example of a job that will not cancel automatically as it's processing a stream! To cancel the job once you're done, you may use the `cancel` API linked [here](/reference-v2/api/jobs/cancel). You may also cancel the job via the dashboard.

## Streaming VTT captions

If you'd like to [stream VTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API#tutorial_on_how_to_write_a_webvtt_file) captions directly to your video player, please follow our [demo here](https://github.com/sieve-community/examples/tree/main/audio_transcription/live_vtt_demo).

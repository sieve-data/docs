description: "Build a video dubbing Sieve app."
---

In this example, we will explore a more complex use case of Sieve. We’ll create an application that automatically dubs a video of a person speaking into another language! We’ll take an input video, transcribe it, translate that text to another language, generate text-to-speech of that translated text, and have the original video lipsync to the new audio.

By following this, you will learn how to:

- Use the Sieve client package to call multiple existing functions in Python
- Combine these functions to create a customized app that meets our requirements

## **Introduction**

As mentioned above, to create an app that can dub videos, we need several models to work together:

1. **WhisperX**: an audio transcription model
2. **SeamlessT2T**: a text-to-text translation model
3. **XTTS-V1**: a text-to-speech model
4. **Sieve Video Retalker**: an optimized version of video retalker for lipsyncing

## Building the app from scratch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up folder and Python file">
    Create a folder and Python file named **`video_dubbing.py`** with the following command:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir video_dubbing
    touch video_dubbing/pipeline.py
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up pipeline">
    Paste the following code into `pipeline.py`. The higher level logic of this code is as follows:
    1. Extract audio from the video
    2. Transcribe the audio
    3. Translate the transcript
    4. Generate new audio from the translated text
    5. Combine audio and video with our lipsyncer

    ```python
    import sieve

    # Helper functions
    def extract_audio(source_video: sieve.File):
        import subprocess
        audio_path = 'temp.wav'
        subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", "-i", source_video.path, audio_path, "-y", "-loglevel", "error"])
        return audio_path

    def transcript_to_text(transcript):
        text = " ".join([segment["text"] for segment in transcript])
        return text

    @sieve.function(
        name="video_dubbing",
        python_packages=[
            "numpy>=1.19.0",
        ],
        system_packages=["ffmpeg"],
    )
    def video_dubbing(source_video: sieve.File, language: str):
        """
        :param source_video: The video to dub
        :param language: The language to dub the video in
        :return: The dubbed video
        """

        print("extracting audio from video")
        source_audio_path = extract_audio(source_video)
        print("done extracting")
        # check if language is supported
        if language not in ["eng", "spa", "fra", "deu", "ita", "por", "pol", "tur", "rus", "nld", "ces", "arb", "cmn"]:
            raise Exception("Language not supported")

        # use remote Sieve functions
        transcriber = sieve.function.get("sieve/speech_transcriber")
        translator = sieve.function.get("sieve/seamless_text2text")
        tts = sieve.function.get("sieve/tts")
        lipsyncer = sieve.function.get("sieve/video_retalking")

        print("transcribing audio")
        source_audio = sieve.File(path=source_audio_path)
        transcript = list(transcriber.run(source_audio))
        text = transcript_to_text(transcript)
        text_language = "eng"
        print("transcription:", text)

        print("translating text")
        translated_text = translator.run(text, text_language, language)
        print("translated text:", translated_text)

        print("generating tts audio")
        source_audio = sieve.File(path=source_audio_path)
        target_audio = tts.run("elevenlabs-voice-cloning", text=translated_text, reference_audio=source_audio, stability=0.5, style=0.5)
        print("done generating audio")

        print("starting lipsync")
        return lipsyncer.run(source_video, target_audio)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        video = sieve.File(url="https://storage.googleapis.com/mango-public-models/david.mp4")
        dubbed_video = video_dubbing(video, "spa")
        print('dubbed video path: ', dubbed_video.path)
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the pipeline">
    <Warning>Make sure you're in the `video_dubbing` directory before running the pipeline.</Warning>
    Run the pipeline with the following command. Because we are running our function with `video_dubbing.run`, where `video_dubbing` is the local Sieve function, this will deploy the Sieve function and then run a job.

    ```bash
    python pipeline.py
    ```

    You should start seeing some logs streaming in. You can also view the status of this job on the Sieve dashboard. After it has completed running, you'll see a video file path printed to the console, which has been saved to a temporary directory. You can open this video to see the results.

  </Step>

  <Step title="View your dubbed file!">
    Open your video in your file explorer with the following command:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Linux/MacOS
      open <video_path>
      ```

      ```bash Windows
      start <video_path>
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Or just view the video on the Sieve dashboard!

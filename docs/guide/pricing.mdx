Sieve prices each developer API based on the parameters used while running a job. Custom functions have compute-based pricing.

<Check>Every account comes with **\$20** of credit to get you started.</Check>

All accounts are on a starter pay-as-you-go plan with limited concurrency. For deployment at scale, we recommend the production plan.
View our plans and pricing in detail [here](https://www.sievedata.com/pricing).

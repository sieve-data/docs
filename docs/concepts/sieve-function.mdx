## Overview

Functions are the fundamental building blocks on Sieve. They have a single entry point and exit point and are defined using standard Python function syntax along with a header that annotates any required dependencies.

All code is mounted by default into `/src` of the container.

## Calling Functions

Functions already deployed on Sieve can both be referenced by using

```python
referenced_function = sieve.function.get("sieve/{function name}")
```

### run

The `.run()` method blocks and waits for the function to complete, and directly returns the value returned by the function.

### push

The `.push()` method returns a `SieveFuture` object, which contains information about the job. You can later access the output using the `.result()` method, for example. This is useful for when you are pushing several jobs at once, like when processing frames from a video. This ensures that you are not waiting for previous frames to finish processing before pushing the next ones, and are taking full advantage of parallel processing.

**Note:** `SieveFuture` objects don't work with traditional `concurrent.futures` methods like `concurrent.futures.as_completed` or `concurrent.futures.wait`. You will have to define a `ThreadPoolExecutor` outside the `.push()` methods to use it in this way.

You can call both `.run()` and `.push()` locally, or within another Sieve function. Calling `.run()` or `.push()` within Sieve, allows you to chain function calls together, enabling powerful AI applications\!

```python Sync Calls i.e Run
# Running Dubbing syncronously
dubbing = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing")
dubbing_job = dubbing.run(file, target_language="spa")
```

```python Async Calls i.e Push
# Running Dubbing asyncronously
dubbing = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing")
dubbing_job = dubbing.push(file, target_language="spa")

# dubbing_job is a Python future, so you can use it in a non-blocking way
print(dubbing_job) # <Future at 0x7f8e3c3e3e50 state=running>
for output_object in dubbing_job.result():
    print(output_object.path) # Path of dubbed file
```

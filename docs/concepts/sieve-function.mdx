title: Sieve Function
---

## Overview

Functions are the fundamental building blocks on Sieve. They have a single entry point and exit point and are defined using standard Python function syntax along with a header that annotates any required dependencies.

All code is mounted by default into `/src` of the container.

## Calling Functions

Functions already deployed on Sieve can both be referenced by using

```python
referenced_function = sieve.function.get("sieve/{function name}")
```

### push

The `.push()` method returns a `SieveFuture` object, which contains information about the job. You can later access the output using the `.result()` method, for example. This is useful for when you are pushing several jobs at once, like when processing frames from a video. This ensures that you are not waiting for previous frames to finish processing before pushing the next ones, and are taking full advantage of parallel processing.

    ```python
    import sieve

    mult = sieve.function.get("username/multiplier")
    multiplication_inputs = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
    multiplication_jobs = []

    # send all of the jobs first
    for multiplication_input in multiplication_inputs:
        multiplication_jobs.append(mult.push(2, multiplication_input))

    # then, once everything is submitted, grab the results
    for multiplication_job in multiplication_jobs:
        print(multiplication_job.result())
    ```

**Note:** `SieveFuture` objects don't work with traditional `concurrent.futures` methods like `concurrent.futures.as_completed` or `concurrent.futures.wait`. You will have to define a `ThreadPoolExecutor` outside the `.push()` methods to use it in this way.

You can call both `.run()` and `.push()` locally, or within another Sieve function. Calling `.run()` or `.push()` within Sieve, allows you to chain function calls together, enabling powerful AI applications!

## Specifying Additional Data for Functions

By default, Sieve functions live inside Linux containers without a GPU and a limited number of python packages installed. You can use a number of key word arguments in the function decorator in order to customize the environment.

| metadata              | sieve.Metadata  | Extra information about the function to be shown on the dashboard. See [below](#using-metadata) for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | None                                                             |
| restart_on_error      | bool            | If this variable is true, if your function ever errors the container will automatically be restarted from scratch. This takes time, but is useful in the event of irreversible failures like GPU corruption. Read more about it [below](#restart-behavior).                                                                                                                                                   | True                                                             |

### Using Metadata

Metadata can be used to provide additional information on the dashboard, including a full title, a description, a code reference, tags, and a readme. You can create a metadata object as follows:

```python
metadata = sieve.Metadata(
    title="Adder",
    description="adds two numbers together",
    code_url="https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/adder/main.py",
    image=sieve.File(
        "https://example.com/cover.gif"
    ),
    tags=["Math", "Example"],
    readme="This is an example readme",
)
```

Then, pass it into the decorator:

```python
@sieve.function(
		name="adder",
		metadata=metadata
)
def adder
```

### Restart Behavior

By default, when errors occur, all Sieve functions are restarted. This means that dependencies, modules, etc., are reloaded into memory. This behavior is intended as a safeguard against irreversible errors, including GPU errors and state-related errors. For production applications, you may choose to disable this so that functions don't restart during more trivial errors, such as invalid inputs or edge cases in code. Restarting functions takes longer but guarantees a brand new state after every function error.

To disable this behavior, you can set the `restart_on_error` parameter in the function header as follows:

```python
@sieve.function(
		name="adder",
		restart_on_error=False,
)
def adder
```

In the event that you disable this behavior by default but also do want to trigger a hard restart in certain scenarios, you can raise a `sieve.FatalException`.

#### sieve.FatalException

A `sieve.FatalException` is a special Python Exception in the Sieve ecosystem that allows you to trigger a hard restart of the function when certain irreversible errors are caught, even if the `restart_on_error` parameter is set to False. Here is a brief example of this in action.

```python
import sieve

@sieve.function(
    name="multiplier",
    restart_on_error=False,
)
def multiply(x1: int, x2: int) -> int:
    if (x1 == 5):
        # This will not restart the function, and subsequent calls will happen instantaneously.
        raise ValueError("x1 is an invalid value")
    if (x2 == 10):
        # This will restart the function, which will give fresh state for the function but may take a bit more time.
        raise sieve.FatalException("x2 is an invalid value, will restart")
    return x1 * x2
```

### Cuda Versions

The CUDA version can be specified with the `cuda_version` parameter in the function decorator. You can specify parts of versions as well (e.g. `'12.2'` for `'12.2.2'`). Possible values for `cuda_version` are:

```
'8.0'
'9.0'
'9.1'
'9.2'
'10.0'
'10.1'
'10.2'
'11.0.3'
'11.1.1'
'11.2.0'
'11.2.1'
'11.2.2'
'11.3.0'
'11.3.1'
'11.4.0'
'11.4.1'
'11.4.2'
'11.4.3'
'11.5.0'
'11.5.1'
'11.5.2'
'11.6.0'
'11.6.1'
'11.6.2'
'11.7.0'
'11.7.1'
'11.8.0'
'12.0.0'
'12.0.1'
'12.1.0'
'12.1.1'
'12.2.2'
'12.3.2'
```

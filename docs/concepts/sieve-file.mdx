title: "Sieve File"

## Overview

`sieve.File` is a utility class that helps with handling files that are inputs to a `function`, produced locally in the file system, or downloaded from an external url.

The underlying contents in a `sieve.File` are backed by Sieve's file servers and are downloaded lazily, meaning that they will not download the content until requested with the `path` property. This means that a `sieve.File` can be passed around to different functions efficiently without having to deal with network overhead.

```python
class File(sieve.Struct):
```

## Constructor Optional Arguments

- `url` (str): The URL of the file to download.
- `path` (str): The local path to the file.

A `File` can be instantiated in two ways, either by providing a local file path, or an external url. You can either pass them in as positional arguments or as keyword arguments to path or url.

```python
import sieve

# Instantiate a sieve File with implied path or url
local_file = sieve.File("path/to/file.txt")
external_file = sieve.File("example.com/file.txt")

# Instantiate a sieve File with a local file path
local_file = sieve.File(path="path/to/file.txt")

# Instantiate a sieve File with a url
external_file = sieve.File(url="example.com/file.txt")

```

## Properties

### url

```python
url: str
```

The url of the file, if it exists. This will return None if the file refers to something on the local filesystem.

```python

import sieve

# Instantiate a File with a url
my_external_file = sieve.File("https://example.com/file.txt") # Will automatically identify it is a URL
my_local_file = sieve.File("path/to/file.txt") # Will automatically identify it is a local path

# Download the file, open it, and read the contents
print(my_external_file.url) # prints "example.com/file.txt"
print(my_local_file.url) # prints None
```

### path

```python
@property
def path(self) -> str:
```

The local path to the file. This will download the file if it is not downloaded already, and return the path of the downloaded file.

**Note:** If files are passed around within Sieve, they may not have a path or URL associated due to the lazy loading properties of Sieve files. To get a path to these files, simply run `.path` on the `sieve.File` object.

```python
import sieve

# Instantiate a File with a url
my_file = sieve.File(url="example.com/file.txt")

# Download the file, open it, and read the contents
opened_file = open(my_file.path, "r")
print(opened_file.read())
```

## Usage

### Python SDK

When pushing to Sieve via SDK, you can simplify pass in a `sieve.File` instance as the argument to the function.

```python
future = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing").push(source_file=sieve.File("path/to/audio.mp3), target_language="spanish") # Returns future
```

```python
output = sieve.function.get("sieve/dubbing").run(source_file=sieve.File("path/to/audio.mp3), target_language="spanish") # Synchronous call
```

### REST API

When pushing via API, you will define the input as a JSON struct similar to the following:

```json
{
  "url": "https://exampleurl.com/file.mp3"
}
```

For the dubbing example, here is what an equivalent cURL request may look like:

```bash

curl --request POST \
  --url https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: $SIEVE_API_KEY' \
  --data '{
  "function": "sieve/dubbing",
  "inputs": {
    "source_file": {
      "url": "https://exampleurl.com/file.mp3"
    },
    "target_language": "spanish"
  }
}'
```

When retrieving outputs for the Sieve job, the structure will be the similar to the JSON format as described above, except contained within a "data" subfield in the object.
We've attached a simplified job JSON below as retrieved from the [Get Job](/reference-v2/api/get-job) endpoint.

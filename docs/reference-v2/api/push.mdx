This endpoint triggers either a workflow or a model with a given set of inputs. The structure of the inputs should match the inputs types specified in the workflow or model definition.

## Example
A workflow that takes in a `sieve.Video` named `video` and a `sieve.Image` named `image` would be triggered with the following request:
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "sample_workflow",
  "inputs": {
    "video": {
      "url": "{SOME_VIDEO_URL}"
    },
    "image": {
      "url": "{SOME_IMAGE_URL}"
    }
  }
}
```

A model that takes in a `str` named `prompt` would be triggered with the following request:
```json
{
  "model_id": "570e75d6-008f-4a5a-93ec-fede6a8675eb",
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "some string"
  }
}
```
